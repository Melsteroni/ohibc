fisheries reporting:
* fisheries reporting is in zones (denoted by polygons)
* some fisheries are reported by cells (4 km cells?)

We will work at 1 km resolution (?)
* create a raster of rgn_id at 1 km resolution
  * does this already exist?
    * yes: prep/spatial/ohibc_rgn_raster_1000m.tif
      * NOTE: the raster has some problems; e.g. Haida Gwaii is filled in
    * also 500 m raster if desired
* create a raster of fishery zones (for csv reporting)
  * at 1 km resolution
* rasterize layers for each year:
  * use nearest neighbor if reclassifying
  * use cell center (default) otherwise; this allows for gdal_rasterize
  * stack together all years of a single fishery for processing
